Description: VOX Jamvox USB Audio Interface Driver
 This package provides a Linux kernel driver for the VOX Jamvox
 USB audio interface. It supports audio playback and recording
 at 44.1kHz and 48kHz sample rates with 16-bit and 24-bit depth.
 .
 The driver is built using DKMS (Dynamic Kernel Module Support)
 which automatically rebuilds the module when the kernel is updated.
